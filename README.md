# OmicsMR
Scripts needed to perform cis-MR using eQTL and pQTL summary stats.  
The scripts have been generated by different people, explaining the two repositories, but represent exactly the same procedure. 

The scripts are ordered in two repositories
* eQTL_MR 
Scripts used for the eQTL MR and the Pwcoco analyses.  
The notebook 'Processing_files_beforeMR' corresponds to the processing of the files needed to make the MR functions run.  
The notebook 'Process_Run_MR_MultipleQTLs' corresponds to the whole pipeline to run MR with application on different cohorts.  
The notebook 'Run_PWCoCo' corresponds to the colocalization analysis.

* pQTL_MR
Scripts used for the pQTL MR and the Pwcoco analyses.
The scripts are ordered in the order of analyses: first MR, then coloc.  
Examples are provided on how to run them in arrays over the different datasets and proteins.
